Hi!
You are very welcome to add levels, obstacles and such in the style of the game. Play the first few levels to get the picture,
and try to create new features, add some new skills.

Let us keep it a fun game like I planned it!

But please preserve the atmosphere and the structure of the game,
like how to embed hints (colliders and GUI images,)
etc.



Thank you,
