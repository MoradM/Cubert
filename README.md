Hi!
You are very welcome to add levels, obstacles and such in the style of the game. Play the first few levels to get the picture,
and try to create new features, add some new skills.

If you add any levels, please make sure to display what level it is as a GUI image.
I have attached the PSD's of the GUI images, so that you can know what font it is and the style, and to be able to edit it
accordingly.

Let us keep it a fun game like I planned it!

But please preserve the atmosphere and the structure of the game,
like how to embed hints (colliders and GUI images,)
etc.


Some good features I have in mind:
(1) A main menu
(2) Ability to save (using PlayerPrefs)
(3) Ability to replay level
(4) Sound!


Thank you,
